Values above 1 (original diffuse color) aren't physically correct, but they can be useful as an art direction knob to increase the amount of bounced light in the scene. Best to keep below 2 as it also causes reflections to be brighter than the scene.                                                                                                                                                 |

Screen space traces bypass Lumen Scene and instead sample Scene Depth and Scene Color. This improves quality, as it bypasses Lumen Scene, but causes view dependent lighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

When hit lighting is used, Translucent meshes will be traced when LumenMaxRefractionBounces > 0, making the reflection tracing more expenssive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| LumenMaxRoughnessToTraceReflections            | float | 0     | 1       | Sets the maximum roughness value for which Lumen still traces dedicated reflection rays. Higher values improve reflection quality, but greatly increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| LumenMaxTraceDistance                          | float | 1     | 2097152 | Controls the maximum distance that Lumen should trace while solving lighting. Values that are too small will cause lighting to leak into large caves, while values that are large will increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| LumenRayLightingMode                           | uint8 | 0     | 3       | Controls how Lumen rays are lit when Lumen is using Hardware Ray Tracing. By default, Lumen uses the Surface Cache for best performance, but can be set to 'Hit Lighting' for higher quality. (Default=0, SurfaceCache=1, HitLightingForReflections=2, HitLighting=3)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| LumenReflectionQuality                         | float | 0.25  | 2       | Scales the Reflection quality. Larger scales reduce noise in reflections, but increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| LumenReflectionsScreenTraces                   | uint8 | 0     | 1       | Whether to use screen space traces for Lumen Reflections. Screen space traces bypass Lumen Scene and instead sample Scene Depth and Scene Color. This improves quality, as it bypasses Lumen Scene, but causes view dependent lighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Larger values will ensure small objects are represented, but increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| LumenSceneLightingQuality                      | float | 0.25  | 2       | Scales Lumen Scene's quality. Larger scales cause Lumen Scene to be calculated with a higher fidelity, which can be visible in reflections, but increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| LumenSceneLightingUpdateSpeed                  | float | 0.5   | 4       | Controls how much Lumen Scene is allowed to cache lighting results to improve performance. Larger scales cause lighting changes to propagate faster, but increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| LumenSceneViewDistance                         | float | 1     | 2097152 | Sets the maximum view distance of the scene that Lumen maintains for ray tracing against. Larger values will increase the effective range of sky shadowing and Global Illumination, but increase GPU cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| LumenSkylightLeaking                           | float | 0     | 0.02    | Controls what fraction of the skylight intensity should be allowed to leak. This can be useful as an art direction knob (non-physically based) to keep indoor areas from going fully black.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| LumenSurfaceCacheResolution                    | float | 0.5   | 1       | Scale factor for Lumen Surface Cache resolution, for Scene Capture. Smaller values save GPU memory, at a cost in quality.

Makes motion blur independent of actual frame rate and relative to the specified target FPS instead. Higher target FPS results in shorter frames, which means shorter shutter times and less motion blur. Lower FPS means more motion blur.
